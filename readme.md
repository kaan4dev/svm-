# SVM Classification Project

This repository, `kaan4dev/svm-`, contains a project focused on implementing and experimenting with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification models. The code and analysis are primarily written in Jupyter Notebook, allowing for an interactive and detailed exploration of SVM techniques in machine learning.

## Features

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation**: Explore SVM models for classification tasks.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform data preprocessing, visualization, and preparation for classification.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Utilize Jupyter Notebooks for step-by-step code execution and analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaan4dev/svm-.git
